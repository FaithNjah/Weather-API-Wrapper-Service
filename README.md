# ðŸŒ¦ Weather API Wrapper Service

A simple backend application that fetches real-time weather data from a third-party API and caches it for faster future requests.  
Built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, this project demonstrates **API integration**, **in-memory caching** (with optional Redis), and **environment variable management** for secure API key handling.
